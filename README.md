# Machine-learning

Let's start with the dataset preparation. I obtained the census income dataset from UCI machine learning 
repository. This dataset contains information about individuals, including their demographic, economic, and 
social attributes. It consists of 32561 samples and 15 features. 
First we import the necessary libraries for the project. These include pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, 
plotly and sklearn. 
The dataset which was uploaded to the google drive is imported using the google.colab library.
The first few rows of the dataframe is displayed using the .head() method. This is done for the quick inspecton 
of the dataframe. 
summary of the dataset is printed using the .info() method. The names of the column, datatype and non null 
count will be outputted. 
The number of attributes and the number of instances is printed using the .shape() method. 
A histogram of of age, capital gain, capital loss and hours per week is plotted. 
We use matlib plot for the plotting. Checking for the class imabalance is an important step in the data 
preparation.
We use seaborn to plot the number of instamces in both classes of the target variable. We understood that 
the difference between the numbers are high. 
I used the describe function to describe the dataset.
I found out if there were any null values in the dataset using the .isnulll() method. 
Seeing there is none, I check if there is missing values in any coloumn using the unique method. I find that 
native country and occupation has missing values. 
Using the .loc() method I found that native country has 583 missing values and occupation has 1816 missing 
values. 
We use drop function to remove the missing values. This is done because the missing values are too less in 
comparison with the actual dataset. 
Bar plot is used to compare different variables in the next line. We use matplot lib to plot the distribution of 
capital gain by occupation and gender. This is the distribution of hours per wek by education and income.
Encoding is done for columns like sex and income so that it become binary in nature. Get_dummies method 
used to convert the values to 0 or 1.
hi squared test is conducted in finding out the best features for model building. Top 15 scores are printed. 
Correlation matrix is also plotted to get the most significant variables for feature selection.
Correlation matrix is printed to find out the most correlated variables to help in the feature selection
The features afe, fnlwgt, education num and hours per week are scaled and stored in the same variable.
Then the features and target variable is sepearted to variable x and variable y. x does not have the target 
variable but y have.
The data is divided into test and train data. Using the sklearn library.
Instances of classifier models like lr, knn, dt, rf, adb, gdboost and xgboost is used to create models.
Simpleimputer is used to impute the mean in places of all nans and missing values
The r2 scores library are imported to find out the accuracy of the models.
The classification scores of all the models are printed. Gdboost and xgboost seen as the best.
The test set is used to predict the future instances using different models.
Confusion matrix of all the models are printed. Confusion matrix is also important in model selection.
Detailed report of all the models are printed.
The graph of confusionmatrix which plots actual values vs predicted values are plotted
AUC_ROC score printed
ROC curve is plotted. We see that the xgboost and gdboost shows the best results.
As xgboost and gdboost have similar values, we use k fold validation to get better results. N_split value is set to 
be 4 and the validation scores are printed. From the cross fold validation, we find out that xgboost is the better 
model as it gives less cross validation.
Hyperparameter tuning is done using the gridsearch method. The parameters of xgboost is printed. The 
parameter grid is defined for tuning. Gridsearchcv object is created. This is done to fit the model using the 
training and testing data.
Best parameters are printed/.
The best parameter of hyperparameter tuning is used to create an instance og xgb classifier. Xgboost is used to 
train data. Target values are used to test the data. Y is predicted using xgboost model and test data. Finally the 
classification report is calculated and printed.
. In conclusion, this project on the census income dataset has allowed me to gain valuable experience in data 
preparation, model training, and evaluation. By leveraging machine learning algorithms and developing a 
robust pipeline, I have successfully built a predictive model for determining whether an individual's income 
exceeds $50,000 per month. The results achieved demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach and its 
potential for real-world applications. Thank you for your attention. I am open to any feedback you may have 
regarding my work on the census income dataset."
To ensure the quality of the data, I performed various preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, 
encoding categorical variables, and removing outliers. Moving on to the data wrangling phase, I explored the 
dataset to gain insights and understand the relationships between variables. I conducted feature engineering 
by creating new variables and transforming existing ones to enhance the predictive power of the models. This 
involved [explain the specific techniques used and their rationale]. For the model training and testing, I 
selected several machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, random forest, and support vector 
machines. These algorithms are known for their effectiveness in classification tasks. I split the dataset into 
training and testing sets, and I trained each model using the training data. To optimize their performance, I 
performed feature selection and hyperparameter tuning. Now, let's dive into the pipeline demonstration. I 
have developed a pipeline that takes input data, preprocesses it according to the steps we discussed earlier, 
and feeds it into the trained model for prediction. The pipeline provides a user-friendly interface to input data 
and produces accurate predictions on the income level of individuals. I will now demonstrate the pipeline in 
action [show the pipeline in action, running it with sample inputs and showcasing the prediction outputs]. 
Moving on to the model evaluation, I assessed the performance of the trained models using evaluation metrics 
such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. I compared the performance of different models to determine 
the most effective one for predicting income. Additionally, I analyzed any limitations or challenges encountered 
during the project and discussed potential areas for improvement. In conclusion, this project on the census 
income dataset has allowed me to gain valuable experience in data preparation, model training, and 
evaluation. By leveraging machine learning algorithms and developing a robust pipeline, I have successfully 
built a predictive model for determining whether an individual's income exceeds $50,000 per month. The 
results achieved demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach and its potential for real-world applications. 
Thank you for your attention. I am open to any questions or feedback you may have regarding my work on the 
census income dataset
